/*
Package imgsim is a library allows you to compute a fast perceptual hashes of an image.
These hashes can then be used to compare images for similarity.
Similar looking images will get similar perceptual hashes, unlike cryptographic hashes that
would be very different for images with slight differences.
This makes them suitable to measure how similar images are.
